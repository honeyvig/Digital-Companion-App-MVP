-----------
To create the MVP of the Digital Companion App for individuals with dementia, we can break the project into key functionalities. Here’s a Python-based solution that covers the main components you’ve listed. We'll use popular libraries like SpeechRecognition, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), and OpenAI GPT (or other simple conversational models) to implement the functionalities.
Key Features:

    User Account and Login
    Avatar Customization
    Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration
    Conversational AI
    Basic Personalization

Libraries and Tools:

    Flask - For the app’s backend.
    SpeechRecognition - For converting speech to text.
    gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) - For converting text to speech.
    OpenAI GPT-3/GPT-4 - For conversational AI.
    SQLite (or any database) - For basic account storage.
    Pillow - For avatar image customization.

Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

To begin, you’ll need to install the libraries.

pip install flask openai SpeechRecognition gtts Pillow sqlite3

Step 2: Set Up Basic Flask App with User Authentication

Let’s create the basic backend structure using Flask for user management (account creation and login) and SQLite to store user data.

import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
import openai
import os
import base64
from PIL import Image
import io
import SpeechRecognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS
import playsound

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Set OpenAI API key (use your own API key)
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Database setup (Simple SQLite for storing user data)
def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('user_data.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users 
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT, avatar_name TEXT, avatar_image BLOB, likes TEXT, dislikes TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

init_db()

# Speech-to-Text Function
def speech_to_text():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Say something:")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
        try:
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            return text
        except Exception as e:
            return "Sorry, I couldn't understand."

# Text-to-Speech Function
def text_to_speech(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en', slow=False)
    filename = "response.mp3"
    tts.save(filename)
    playsound.playsound(filename)

# Basic Conversational AI using OpenAI GPT
def generate_response(user_input):
    prompt = f"The following is a friendly conversation with a digital companion. User: {user_input} Avatar:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",  # Can also use gpt-3.5-turbo
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Route for user login
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    
    # Simulated login check (for simplicity, you can extend it)
    conn = sqlite3.connect('user_data.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?", (username,))
    user = c.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    
    if user:
        return jsonify({"message": "Login successful", "username": user[1]})
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "User not found"}), 404

# Route for user registration
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    avatar_name = request.json.get('avatar_name')
    avatar_image = request.json.get('avatar_image')  # Image uploaded as base64
    likes = request.json.get('likes')
    dislikes = request.json.get('dislikes')

    # Saving user to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('user_data.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, avatar_name, avatar_image, likes, dislikes) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
              (username, avatar_name, avatar_image, likes, dislikes))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully"}), 201

# Route for starting the conversation
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json.get('message')
    if user_input:
        # Generate AI response
        response = generate_response(user_input)
        
        # Return the AI's response and use TTS for voice output
        text_to_speech(response)
        
        return jsonify({"response": response})
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "No message received"}), 400

# Avatar Upload (Base64) and Customization
@app.route('/upload_avatar', methods=['POST'])
def upload_avatar():
    avatar_image_base64 = request.json.get('avatar_image')
    avatar_image_data = base64.b64decode(avatar_image_base64)
    
    # Save avatar image as file (optional)
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(avatar_image_data))
    image.save('avatar.png')  # Save the uploaded image as 'avatar.png'

    return jsonify({"message": "Avatar uploaded successfully!"})

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Explanation of the Code

    User Registration and Login:
        The user can register and login through the /register and /login endpoints.
        Registration stores the user’s data, including their avatar image (encoded as base64), name, likes, and dislikes in the SQLite database.
        Login allows existing users to authenticate.

    Avatar Customization:
        The /upload_avatar endpoint allows users to upload their custom avatar (as base64). The image is saved and could later be displayed in the app.

    Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:
        Speech-to-Text (speech_to_text()): Converts the user’s voice into text.
        Text-to-Speech (text_to_speech()): Converts AI-generated responses into audible speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

    Conversational AI:
        The /chat endpoint uses OpenAI GPT (or another conversational model) to generate a response based on user input.
        The generated text is returned as a response, and the gTTS is used to audibly speak the response.

Step 4: Frontend Integration

For simplicity, this example uses Flask to create the backend. The frontend can interact with this backend by making HTTP requests to the endpoints like /register, /login, /upload_avatar, and /chat.
Step 5: Testing and Deployment

    Testing Locally: Run the Flask server (python app.py) and test using Postman or curl.
    Frontend Integration: Frontend can send data to this backend for avatar creation, user registration, and chatting.

Future Enhancements:

    Advanced Personalization: Store more personalized user data and tailor conversations based on the user's history and preferences.
    Voice Interaction Interface: Add a voice-based interface (e.g., integrating a web-based voice UI using Web APIs or React components).
    Security: Implement secure authentication (e.g., using JWT or OAuth).

This app provides a basic digital companion experience for individuals with dementia, offering comfort through conversations with a customizable, voice-enabled avatar.
